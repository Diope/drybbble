// Note: I decided to use cloudinary to host my images if only so I didn't have to handle random name generation, creating thumbnails off the main image, resizing, and scaling. As much as I like problem solving and creating solutions from scratch, I'm also pragmatic. This project is already going to take me freakin months upon months to get done. Let's speed up where we can eh?
